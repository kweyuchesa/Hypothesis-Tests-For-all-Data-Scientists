    "    Welch’s t-test is a hypothesis test for determining if two populations have different means. There are a number of varieties of this test, but we will look at the two sample version and we will ask if high performing salespeople generate higher sales than low performing salespeople in the population. We start by assuming our null hypothesis which is that the difference in mean sales between high performers and low performers in the population is zero or less. Now we calculate our difference in means statistic for our sample."
